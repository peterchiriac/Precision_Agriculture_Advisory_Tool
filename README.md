Farmers face significant challenges in optimising fertiliser application due to the absence of integrated tools that provide real-time, actionable data. This gap often results in inefficient nutrient use, leading to diminished yields, increased costs, and environmental strain. Moreover, crops subjected to either excessive or insufficient fertiliser application frequently fail to develop an optimal nutrient profile, compromising their quality and nutritional value. The central question this project seeks to address is: How can farmers leverage data to optimise nutrient application effectively?
